  _Transforms Google Maps data into a sales pipeline with a dedicated map_

**Professionally** you can check my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/axel-vincent/ ), it's 7+ years of professional NodeJS. I've previously worked at the early stage of 1 rideshare startup acquired by **FreeNow** **(BMW)**, 1 payment startup doing corporate benefits through payment that's now a unicorn: **[Swile](https://www.swile.co/)**, and one micro finance app that's still growing: **[Shares](https://www.shares.io/)**.
