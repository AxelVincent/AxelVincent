### Hi there üëã

Here is some projects I've built recently for fun 
- [Zikos](https://zikos.io/)  
  _Playlist maker using the Spotify recommendation algorithm (made with Express/React/Railway)_
- [Baby Shower Club](https://www.babyshower.club/)  
  _Affiliation marketing website on baby products to learn SEO from zero (made with Webflow and automated using Figma for Webflow)_

Currently working on a lead generation tool, see you end of October for the release ‚úåÔ∏è

**Professionally** you can check my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/axel-vincent/ ), it's 6+ years of professional NodeJS. I've previously worked at the early stage of 1 rideshare startup acquired by **FreeNow** **(BMW)**, 1 payment startup doing corporate benefits through payment that's now a unicorn: **Swile**, and one micro finance app that's still growing: **Shares**.
