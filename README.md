### Hi there 👋

Here is some projects I've built recently to have fun 
- [Zikos](https://zikos.io/)  
  _Playlist maker using the spotify recommendation algorithm (made with Express/React/Railway)_
- [Baby Shower Club](https://www.babyshower.club/)  
  _Affiliation marketing website on baby products (made with Webflow and automated using Figma for Webflow)_

Currently working on a lead generation tool, see you end of October for the release ✌️
